			<p style="margin: 0; font-size: 20px;">Myself is Shah Alam. My nick name is Sani. My friends and colleagues are loves to call me Sani. I belong from Bangladesh. I born and raised in Bangladesh. I grew up in Narshingdi but now live in Dhaka. I would describe myself as a quiet person but very talkative inside my head. A thousand of things are running in my mind while staying quiet. Even while talking, analyzing and thinking with my own algorithms. I would say that I am self-aware and know what will make me happy on a long term.
